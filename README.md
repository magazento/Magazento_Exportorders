<p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff6600;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>By using this Magento Extension, any store admin can import or export all order data plus any other&nbsp;data related to the customer. Furthermore, this extension can be used for managing any related data. These are available for any of&nbsp;your site&rsquo;s customers, regardless whether the checkout was made as a guest or as a registered member.</p>
<p>This extension is also capable of exporting the products order and product details in batch format, as&nbsp;well as to import the orders from your customers which already exist in your store&rsquo;s database. In case&nbsp;the customer isn&rsquo;t registered or does not exists, the extension will assign order for guest.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p><strong>- Import or Export orders for any type of customers</strong></p>
<p>Regardless which type of orders your Magento store relies on, this extension is able to import or export&nbsp;them in one go. It can easily deal with configurable, grouped, bundle, virtual, simple and downloadable&nbsp;orders, plus more!</p>
<p><strong>- Import orders from the customers who are not registered on your site</strong></p>
<p>If the user does not exists, the order will be marked as being made by guest (all the address information&nbsp;and settings are retained). Thus, it will be a lot easier to manage this type of data in the future.</p>
<p><strong>- Import orders without having to worry about duplicates</strong></p>
<p>When a coincidence with one of the existing orders in the database is detected, the value of the&nbsp;imported order is overwritten and is generated automatically by the system. Therefore, you won&rsquo;t have&nbsp;to worry about any order duplicates or complicated settings.</p>
<p><strong>- Import orders with Shipments</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the shipping method that&rsquo;s been selected by your customer on his order, you&rsquo;ll be able to&nbsp;import it in one go, without any technical difficulties. Even if the shipping method is not enabled or can&rsquo;t&nbsp;be found at the import time, the extension still allows you to import the order with no hassle.</p>
<p><strong>- Import orders with Invoices</strong></p>
<p>The payment method that&rsquo;s been selected by your customer is not of importance when importing the<br />order. It will be easily imported at once, even if the payment method can be found in the database or<br />doesn&rsquo;t exist at the import time.</p>
<p><strong>- Import orders with CreditMemos</strong><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>The Magento Dataflow Batch Import/Export handles invoices,shipments, credit memos or any other<br />kind of customer related information at the time of import. The history of all comments and the status<br />changes are also tracked by the extension.</p>
<p>- Enables you to use export filters to choose the necessary orders</p>
<p>When exporting data through this extension, it allows you to use export filters in order to restrict certain<br />data from being imported. Thus, you&rsquo;re able to use the following filters on your exports: Store filter,<br />Creation date, Order Status.</p>
